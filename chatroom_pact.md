## [PHP Chatroom](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php) Pact

### Chatroom Dos :
 1. Use [viper-7.com](http://codepad.viper-7.com), [eval.in](http://eval.in), [pastie.org](http://pastie.org/) or [3v4l.org](http://3v4l.org/) to post code when asking for help.
 2. [Format your code](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq#formatting) when asking for help.
 3. Be respectful toward everyone you engage.
 4. Extend charity outward to the SO community; if you get help, then help someone else.
 5. Greet with *"good morning"* (or other non day-time based greeting) regardless of your local time. See [UGT](http://www.total-knowledge.com/~ilya/mips/ugt.html).
 6. *Large* images (includes GIFs), should be un-markdowned by appending `?x` to file extension.

### Chatroom Don'ts :
 1. Dump a link to your question (spamming).
 2. Randomly ping people. Particularly, don't ping many people at once (usually you're just being nice, but it's annoying).
 3. Ask to ask a question. *"I have a problem, can anyone help?!"*
 4. Repeat the same question. Every 30 seconds, since no-one replied to you yet!
 5. Star messages that are too specific to understand in general context, or random messages without interest.
 6. Use the room as a replacement for the main site. We are not the question banned users refugee camp.
 6. Ignore the "Chatroom Don'ts".
